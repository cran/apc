\details{Forms ad hoc identified time effects from the canonical parameter.
These are used either indirectly by \code{\link{apc.plot.fit}}
or they are computed directly with this command.

The ad hoc identifications are based on	Nielsen (2014b). For details see also the vignette
	\href{../doc/Identification.pdf}{\code{Identification.pdf}},
	\href{../doc/Identification.R}{\code{Identification.R}}
	on
	\href{../doc/index.html}{\code{Vignettes}}		
or in the notes below.

For model designs of any type two ad hoc identified time effects.

(1)
The type "sum.sum" (same as "ss.dd") gives double sums anchored in the middle of
the first period diagonal. 

(2)
The type "detrend" gives double sums that start in zero and end in zero.

For model designs with only two time effects, that is "AC", "AP", "PC" there is
a further ad hoc identification.

(3)
The type "demean" gives single sums of single differences. Derived from "detrend" where the
linear trends are attributed to the double sums of double differences. Level unchanged.

(4)
The type "dif" gives the single differences derived from "demean".  Could also have been chosen
as canonical parametrisation for these models.

\note{* indicates that values only implemented for designs "AC", "AP", "PC".

The differences are not identified for design "APC".  An arbitrary level can be moved between differences for
age, period and cohort.  

The differences are not identified for designs "Ad", "Pd", "Cd".  These models have two linear trends and one set of
double differences.  In the model "Ad", as an example, one linear trend will be associated with age, but it is
arbitrary whether the second linear trend should be associated with period or cohort.  The slope of the age trend
will depend on that arbitrary choice.  In turn the level of the age differences will be arbitrary.  

(1)
The type "sum.sum" (same as "ss.dd") gives double sums anchored 
to be zero in the three points where
\code{age=cohort=U},
\code{age=U+1,cohort=U}
\code{age=U,cohort=U+1}
with
\code{apc.fit.model$U}
and where
\code{U}
is the integer value of
\code{(per.zero+3)/2}
This corresponds to the representation in
Nielsen (2014b).
The linear plane is parametrised in terms of 
a level, which is the value of the predictor at
\code{age=cohort=U};
an age slope, which is the difference of the values of the predictor at
\code{age=U+1,cohort=U}
and 
\code{age=cohort=U};
an cohort slope, which is the difference of the values of the predictor at
\code{age=U,cohort=U+1}
and 
\code{age=cohort=U}.

(2)
The type "detrend" gives double sums that start in zero and end in zero.
The linear plane is parametrised in terms of
a level, which is the value of the predictor at 
\code{age=cohort=1}, which is usually outside the index set for the data;
while age and cohort slopes are adjusted for the ad hoc identification of the time effects.

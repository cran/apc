\title{This plot shows time series of matrix within age, period or cohort.}
\description{Produces six plots showing time series of matrix within age, period or cohort against one of the other two indices.
	These plots are sometimes used to gauge how many of the age, period, cohort factors are needed:
	If lines are parallel when dropping one index the corresponding factor may not be needed.
	In practice these plots should possibly be used with care, see Italian bladder cancer example below.}
\usage{apc.plot.data.within(apc.data.list,
					data.type="r",thin=NULL,apc.index=NULL,
					ylab=NULL,type="o",log="y",legend=TRUE,
					lty=1:5,col=1:6,bty="n",main.outer=NULL)}
\arguments{
	\item{apc.data.list}{List. See \code{\link{apc.data.list}} for a description of the format.}
 	\item{data.type}{Optional. Character. "r"/"d"/"m" if sums are computed for responses/dose/mortality rates, where mortality rates are found through division response/dose. "r" is default.} 
  	\item{thin}{Optional. Numerical.  age/periods/cohorts are grouped in groups of size thin.  Default is computed from dimensions of data.  A warning is produced if dimension is not divisible by thin, so that one group is smaller than other groups.}
	\item{apc.index}{Optional. List. See \code{\link{apc.get.index}} for a description of the format.  If not provided this is computed.}
  	\item{ylab}{Optional \code{\link{plot}} argument.  Character.  Common label for y-axes. Default is "".}
	\item{type}{Optional \code{\link{plot}} argument. Character. "o" if overlaid points and lines. "l" if lines. "p" if points. Default is "o".}
  	\item{log}{Optional \code{\link{plot}} argument. Character. "y" if y-scale is logarithmic, otherwise "". Default is "y"}
  	\item{legend}{Optional \code{\link{plot}} argument. Logical. Should legends be drawn? Default is TRUE.}
  	\item{lty}{Optional \code{\link{plot}} argument. Vector of line types.
			The first element is for the first column, the second element for the second column, etc.,
			even if lines are not plotted for all columns. Line types will be used cyclically
			until all plots are drawn.  Default is 1:5}
  	\item{col}{Optional \code{\link{plot}} argument. Vector of colors.
			The first element is for the first column, the second element for the second column, etc.,
			even if lines are not plotted for all columns. Colors will be used cyclically
			until all plots are drawn.  Default is 1:6.}
  	\item{bty}{Optional \code{\link{plot}} argument. Character.
			The type of box to be drawn around the legend.
			The allowed values are "n" and "o".	Default is "n".}
  	\item{main.outer}{Optional. Character. Main title for plot, to be shown in outer margin.  Default is NULL, in which case a title is generated internally.}

#  	Generate a 3x4 matrix in "AP" data.format with the numbers 1..12
#	Then make a data list
#	Then plot data.
#  	Note: this deterministic matrix has neither age, period, or cohort factors,
#		 only linear trends.  Thus all 6 plots have parallel lines.

Description: Functions for age-period-cohort analysis. Aggregate data can be organised in matrices indexed by age-cohort, age-period or cohort-period. The data can include dose and response or just doses. The statistical model is a generalized linear model (GLM) allowing for 3,2,1 or 0 of the age-period-cohort factors. Individual-level data should have a row for each individual and columns for each of age, period, and cohort. The statistical model for repeated cross-section is a generalized linear model. The statistical model for panel data is ordinary least squares. The canonical parametrisation of Kuang, Nielsen and Nielsen (2008) <DOI:10.1093/biomet/asn026> is used. Thus, the analysis does not rely on ad hoc identification.
